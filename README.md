# Introduction to Object-Oriented Paradigm
This repository contains a Java-based project developed as part of the Object-Oriented Paradigm coursework at Télécom Paris. The aim of this project is to apply object-oriented principles to model and simulate a functional robot production factory.

The project was developed incrementally through a series of lab sessions (TPs) and exercises (TDs), which are all included in this repository. 


# Project Requirements 
1. Factory Model:
	•	Factory layout with rooms, doors, robots, charging stations, conveyor belts, and production machines.

2. Robot Simulation:
	•	Each robot follows a defined path (sequence of positions).
	•	Robots avoid obstacles during navigation.
	•	Energy consumption is simulated based on robot speed.
	•	Robots automatically move to a charging station when energy is low, wait to recharge, then resume tasks.

3. GUI Visualization:
	•	The factory and robot movements are visualized through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

4. Save/Load Functionality:
	•	The system supports saving and loading the simulation model to/from disk.

5. Exception Handling:
	•	The application handles runtime exceptions (e.g., file access issues).

6. Good Programming Practices:
	•	Clean class organization, proper naming, consistent formatting, and helpful comments.
	•	MVC architecture respected as taught in the course.

What is not included

The project intentionally omits advanced topics :
	•	Concurrency or multithreading.
	•	Distributed systems.
	•	Database integration.
	•	Network communication.
